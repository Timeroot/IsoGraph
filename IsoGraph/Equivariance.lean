# Towards invariance: equivariance of the pieces

`IsoGraph/Spec.lean` states the one deep obligation of the development,

```lean
canonAdj n (relabel σ adj) = canonAdj n adj
```

and its docstring records the six-step decomposition it needs.  This file starts turning that
prose into Lean.  It works at the level of `IsoGraph.Canonical`, i.e. with raw `Array Nat`s and
permutations of `{0, …, n-1}` represented as `Nat → Nat`, since that is where the algorithm
lives; the translation to `Equiv.Perm (Fin n)` happens back in `Spec.lean`.

What is here so far is the *bottom* layer: how `Graph.ofOracle` responds to renaming, and the two
readers of a partition (`shapeHash`, `targetCell`) that see only cell boundaries.  These are the
facts every later step is phrased in terms of.  The steps about `refineStep` and about the search
tree are not here yet.

/-! ## Permutations of an initial segment -/

/-- `σ` permutes `{0, …, n-1}`: it maps the segment into itself and is injective there.  Since
the segment is finite this is the same as being a bijection of it, but the two clauses are what
the proofs actually use. -/

/-! ## `Graph.ofOracle`

The algorithm never reads an oracle directly: it reads the `adj` matrix and the `nbr` lists that
`Graph.ofOracle` builds from it.  So every statement about renaming vertices has to pass through
these three lemmas. -/

/-! ## Readers of a partition that see only the cell boundaries

Step 2 of the decomposition: `shapeHash` and `targetCell` walk the partition cell by cell using
`cen` alone, never touching `lab`.  So they agree on any two partitions with the same boundaries
— in particular on partitions related by a renaming of the vertices, whatever that renaming does
inside the cells. -/

/-- The cell walk only ever reads `cen` at indices `< n`, so two `cen`s that agree there send it
along the same path.  Both congruence lemmas below are this observation at `fuel = n`, `i = 0`. -/
theorem cenHashFrom_congr {n : Nat} {c d : Array Nat} (h : ∀ i, i < n → c[i]! = d[i]!) :

/-! ## Certificates

Step 4 of the decomposition, certificate half.  A certificate is the adjacency matrix read in the
order given by `lab`; so renaming the vertices along `σ` and reading in the order `lab` gives the
same bits as leaving the graph alone and reading in the order `σ ∘ lab`.  This is the point at
which "the search found corresponding leaves" turns into "the two runs return the same array". -/

/-- One packed row only reads columns `j < n`.  The fuel invariant `j + fuel = n` is what makes
that available: it says the loop is at position `j` with `fuel` columns left, so `fuel ≥ 1`
forces `j < n`. -/
theorem certRow_congr {n : Nat} {b b' : Nat → Bool} (h : ∀ j, j < n → b j = b' j) :
